New York State Route 308 is a 6.19-mile-long (9.96 km) state highway within northern Dutchess County in New York State that connects U.S. Route 9 and NY 9G. The western end of the highway is in the Rhinebeck Village Historic District, a 2.6-square-mile (6.7 km2) area that features 272 buildings in a variety of architectural styles. NY 308 passes near the Dutchess County Fairgrounds, several historical landmarks, and the Landsman Kill River, a minor tributary of the Hudson River. Around 1685, the Native American Sepasco Trail ran from the Hudson eastward through modern-day Rhinebeck and ended at Lake Sepasco, roughly following NY 308 and its side roads. The trail remained until 1802, when part of the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike was chartered over it, extending from Salisbury, Connecticut, to the Susquehanna River at or near the town of Jericho (now Bainbridge). NY 308 incorporates a portion of the former turnpike.
